 Solr 6.2 added the functionality to allow CDCR to replicate the entire index from the Source to the Target data centers on first time startup as an alternative to the following procedure. For very large indexes, time should be allocated for the initial synchronization if this option is chosen.

 This is a general approach for initializing CDCR in a production environment based upon an approach taken by the initial working installation of CDCR and generously contributed to illustrate a "real world" scenario.

+=== Bi-directional solution
+
+[TIP]
+====
+Solr 7.2 introduces bi-directional approach and it highly recommended to enable Cdcr on both cluster-collections before any indexing has taken place.
+====
+Taking the same example from uni-directional solution, and stating the recommended steps:
+
+* Before starting, stop or pause the indexers. This is best done during a small maintenance window.
+* Stop the SolrCloud instances at the cluster-1 and cluster-2.
+* Upload the modified `solrconfig.xml` to ZooKeeper on both cluster-1 and cluster-2 as appropriate, see the examples above.
+* If documents are indexed prior to this exercise, sync the index directories from the cluster-1 collection to cluster-2 collection across to the corresponding shard nodes or vice versa. `rsync` works well for this. Make sure the the updated index is copied across.
++
+For example, if there are 2 shards on collection 'cluster1' (the updated collection) with 2 replicas for each shard, copy the corresponding index directories from:
++
+[width="75%",cols="45,10,45"]
+|===
+|shard1replica1cluster1 |to |shard1replica1cluster2
+|shard1replica2cluster1 |to |shard1replica2cluster2
+|shard2replica1cluster1 |to |shard2replica1cluster2
+|shard2replica2cluster1 |to |shard2replica2cluster2
+|===
+
+* Start the ZooKeeper on the cluster-1 side.
+* Start the ZooKeeper on the cluster-2 side.
+* Start the SolrCloud on the cluster-1 side.
+* Start the SolrCloud on the cluster-2 side.
+* If not present, create respective collections on both cluster-1 and cluster-2 sides.
+* Activate the CDCR on cluster-1 and cluster-2 instance using the CDCR API:
++
+[source,text]
+http://host:port/solr/<collection_name>/cdcr?action=START
++
+* Disable the buffer on the cluster-1 and cluster-2:
++
+[source,text]
+http://host:port/solr/collection_name/cdcr?action=DISABLEBUFFER
++
+* Re-enable indexing.

 == ZooKeeper Settings
 
 With CDCR, the Target ZooKeepers will have connections from the Target clouds and the Source clouds. You may need to increase the `maxClientCnxns` setting in `zoo.cfg`.
